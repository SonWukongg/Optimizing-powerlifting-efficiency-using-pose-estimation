# Optimizing-powerlifting-efficiency-using-pose-estimation
## Description
This app was built for my final year project at the University of bath and aims to provide powerliftes with immediate technique refinment. Due to the rise of online coaching users are unable to get immediate feedback from their coaches and is a problem I faced myself. By using the Apple Vision framework (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision), I was able to create an app that can help users get feedback. Please watch the demo video here: https://youtu.be/ATfiJYyzot8


## Running the app
The app was developed in the following:
* xCode - version 14.2
* iPhone 11 - running ios 16.3.1

The Vision framework uses CoreML and anthing running CoreML must run on a device. So you will not be able to run this app on a emulator environment. To run the app on your phone please download the folder and make sure your device is running the correct versions. You will need to make sure your device is set to developer mode (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/enabling-developer-mode-on-a-device). You will also need to make sure you have a developer apple ID. You then need to go to signing and capabilities in xCode and make sure the team names is changed to your personal idea. You can now finally change the device you wish to run the code on to your personal device. 

If you need help running the app please fell free to contact me on dicord: Kakarot#1061
