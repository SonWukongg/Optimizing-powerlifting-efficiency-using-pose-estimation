# Optimizing-powerlifting-efficiency-using-pose-estimation

This app is developed in an attempt to provide powerlifters with immediate technique refinement. The app makes use of apples Vision framework (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision) in order to provide the users with feedback. 

The app was developed an iPhone 11 running iOS 16.3.1. I have set the deployment version to iOS 16 so if you wish to run it you must be running iOS 16+.
